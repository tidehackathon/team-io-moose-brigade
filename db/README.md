# Database Setup

Databases in SEMOSS contain a ".smss" file which holds connection details and a corresponding folder containing metadata around the database. As an example. TIDE__666faa3d-ec1a-4109-8889-8b7e17470ccf folder and TIDE__666faa3d-ec1a-4109-8889-8b7e17470ccf.smss represent a single database together.

Database metamata is stored in a OWL file which describes the database tables, columns, and connections.
You will need to update the ".smss" file with the proper credentails. 

You can create a zip file containing the database smss file with its corresponding database folder and upload it into your SEMOSS instance through the catalog UI:
