# Database Setup

Databases in SEMOSS contain a ".smss" file which holds connection details and a corresponding folder containing metadata around the database. As an example. TIDE__666faa3d-ec1a-4109-8889-8b7e17470ccf folder and TIDE__666faa3d-ec1a-4109-8889-8b7e17470ccf.smss represent a single database together.

Database metamata is stored in a OWL file which describes the database tables, columns, and connections.
You will need to update the ".smss" file with the proper credentails. 

You can zip up the database folder and the smss file together and upload it into your instance through the SEMOSS catalog UI.
